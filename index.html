   </h2>

   <div align="center">
    <p>On the morning of April 15, 1912, the sinking of the Titanic the previous night shocked the world. The ship was considered to have been so well constructed it was believed she could sustain any amount of damage and still remain afloat. Late on the night of April 14, 1912, the sinking of the Titanic proved this idea wrong in a horribly tragic way.

    The causes of Titanic to sink have been the subject of much study and debate. In 1912 the sinking of the Titanic began late on the night of April 14th. Information on the sinking Titanic indicates that the ship approached a massive iceberg, and although efforts were made to steer clear of the large frozen mass, all efforts were to no avail. 

    There were far too few lifeboats on board, and hardly any were filled to capacity. As a result roughly 700 of the 2,224 passengers survived the wreck. They were picked up by the Carpathia, a nearby ship. In this data set we try to ask some questions.

  <div align="center">
    <p>So...</p>
    <p>1. What demographics made it possible for the passengers to survive?</p>
    <p>2. How did being a male or a female affect survival? What numbers of men and women survived?</p>
    <p>3. Were survivors from a higher class?</p>

  </div>


  <div align="center">
    <div id="img1"></div>
    <p>Females have almost 2X the survival rates compared to men even though there are ~ 2X men on the ship</p>
  </div>

  <div  align="center">
    <div id="img2"></div>
    <p>Children were higher amongst the survivors for obvious reasons.</p>
  </div>

  <div  align="center">
    <div id="img3"></div>
    <p>People in the higher class have 2X chances of survival compared to lower classes. Though middle class seem to show not much of a bias</p>
  </div>


  
  <div class="Conclusions">
    <p>1. We were able to get qualitative understanding of the people who survived the disaster, It is pretty clear that being a young woman in the upper class having paid more have the highest rates of survival.</p>
    <p>2. We were also able to get quantitive values of the people who survived the disaster, mainly women survived more often and by significant margin. 197 of the 261 women in the data set survived, that's a survival chance of 75% when compared to a survival chance of 20.52% for men.</p>
    <p>3. It was found that survivors on an average paid almost 2X as much compared to their dead counterparts to buy their tickets to survival into a higher class. People who survived has a class average of 1.8. Close to 2nd Class but also many in class 1.</p>
