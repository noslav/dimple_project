  <div class="Conclusions">
    <p>1. We were able to get qualitative understanding of the people who survived the disaster, It is pretty clear that being a young woman in the upper class having paid more have the highest rates of survival.</p>
    <p>2. We were also able to get quantitive values of the people who survived the disaster, mainly women survived more often and by significant margin. 197 of the 261 women in the data set survived, that's a survival chance of 75% when compared to a survival chance of 20.52% for men.</p>
